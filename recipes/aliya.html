    <h2>Description</h2> <!--What is Aliya-->
    <p>Aliya is smoked and sun dried meat. So basically raw meat is sliced into thin pieces then it is sun dried during the day and smoked during the night. this is a common practice within the Luo tribe in Kenay.</p>
    <p>The is done to preserve the meat for later use since there are no fridges and freezers in the village. The minimum number of days to dry and smoke the meat to make sure it does not go bad is three days</p>
    <p>After the three days you can choose to continue smoking it or you can just save it for later date or eat it your choice</p>
    <p>P.S this dish is way more delicions if cooked in Agulu (clay pot)</p>
